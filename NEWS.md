* small documentation updates

Changes version 1.10.6 (Thomas) 
================================
* change declaration of variable dimensions from `(1)` to `(*)` in legacy
  Fortran code to pass automatic bounds check
* remove the Jacobian examples from `?ode` because `banddown=0` can
  lead to problems on some systems; examples will come back in a
  next release
* fixed bug in the `iteration` solver
* small documentation updates

Changes version 1.10.5 (Karline, Thomas)
================================
* extended subset.deSolve with argument `arr`, when TRUE returns an
  array for >2-D output
* fixed the R compiler notes
* `plot.ode.2D` now has an `mtext` argument, via the `...`, to label multiple 
  figures in margin... CHECK - see ode.2D
* `subset` can also be a vector with indices in addition to logical
* image with `legend = TRUE` changed size of plot in different layouts - now solved
  (by adding `par(mar = par("mar"))`)
* new method to output warnings and error messages 
* add data type check for external outputs in rk_util.c

================================
* allow reverted time vector for fixed step solvers

* all solvers now have default `atol = 1e-6`; before this `daspk` and `vode` had 1e-8.
* multiple warnings from `daspk` if num steps = 500 toggled off.
* added input argument `nind` to `daspk`, to make it compatible with `radau`.
  this also changes the way the variables are weighed, 
  hence this differs from the original daspk 2.0 code.
* improved warning printing in `daspk` and `vode` 
* extended sparse Jacobian input in `lsodes`. (2-D and 3-D sparsity
  with mapping var and arbitrary sparsity in ian/jan format).

* rwork and iwork in lsodes from Fortran -> C (to remove compiler warnings)
* roots + events:  now certain roots can stop simulation + fixed bug in radau root
* improved events\roots help file
* diagnostics(out) gave error in case method=iteration (no rstate) now fixed
* the package authors agreed to assign the maintainer role to T.P.,
but the order of authorship and credits remain unchanged.

* remove NAs from forcing functions - when used in DLL (file forcings.R)
* new argument `restructure` in ode.1D, for use with implicit solvers not in deSolve
* removed requirement to have eventfunc in compiled code when func is in compiled code
* subsetting on summary.deSolve

* vignette improved
* fixed bug in 'timesteps'

==============================================
* fixed compiler warnings using valgrind

* Dormand-Prince 8(7) coefficients use now common 
  instead of decimal fractions

* Runge-Kuttas:
    - extra output: number of failed steps (see also 2)
    - number of function evaluations + 1 for initial condition
    - dense output for cash-karp
    - dopri8(7) added
    - radau added!! implicit runge kutta, solves also DAE up to index 3!

    - image function for ode.2-D added.
    - changed warning printing in FORTRAN code
    - common interface for radau and daspk:
      both can solve systems written as M*dy = f(x,y).
      daspk can also solve systems written as 0 = g(x,y,dy) (=default for daspk)
